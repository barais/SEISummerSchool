HEADS: ThingML and Kevoree working together
===

![HEADS](http://heads-project.eu/sites/default/files/heads_large.png)

Now that you have learned the basics of ThingML and Kevoree (tutorial 1 and 2), it is time to combine them! 

ThingML is the HEADS modelling language dedicated to the implementation of your HD-services. It provides a white-box view on your services.
Kevoree manages these implementations as black-boxes and will deploy and dynamically manage the HD-services.

> First update your HEADS IDE (assuming you have downloaded [one of that versions before](http://coreff5.istic.univ-rennes1.fr/jenkins/job/headside/ws/products.minimal/target/products/)). In `Help -> Install New Sofware...` add the ThingML update site (http://dist.thingml.org/update) and install ThingML. This will actually perform an update. Next time, simply go in `Help -> Check for Updates`

###This tutorial covers

A set of simple exercises to:

- understand the public APIs generated by ThingML, and how they can be use to integrate with other code, such as Kevoree, **or even your own code**
- understand the different ways of mapping ThingML configurations to Kevoree deployment models
- use the ThingML to Kevoree/Java automatic transformation
- use the ThingML to Kevoree/JS automatic transformation

> We assume you have done tutorial 1 and 2 and that you start to be familiar with ThingML and Kevoree.

###Simple demo application

This tutorial will be based on a trivial application, composed of:

- a timer
- a timer client, which start/cancel/re-start the timer and prints a tick on timeout

> The goal of this tutorial is obviously not on defining advanced logic, but rather **to understand
how ThingML can be transformed into Kevoree components, and how the code produced by ThingML can be integrated with legacy/third party code.**
