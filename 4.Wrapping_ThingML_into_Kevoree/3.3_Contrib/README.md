Now that you are an expert in ThingML and Kevoree, and now that you have understood how the two work together, it is time for you to shine!

You are quite free for this exercise and can reuse/extend your previous contributions.

###Requirements

- At least two ThingML configurations should be compiled to two Kevoree components
- The generated Kevoree components should not be "isolated" and should communicate together (you have to bind them in your Kevoree models)
- It would be good (though not mandatory) that some components target Java and some others JavaScript
- For HEADS use case partners: try to make this contribution a basic proof-of-concept for your future implementation
- Do not get stuck, ask questions by e-mail, post issues, fix some minor issues yourself, etc
